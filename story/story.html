                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>Healthybyjeen was founded by two brothers who combined their professional backgrounds and personal experiences. One brother had been working abroad since 2011, gaining management experience in the hospitality industry, while the other built his career as a fitness coach. After returning to Lebanon in the aftermath of the September 2024 events and following the loss of close family members during the war they decided to settle in their home country and create something meaningful. Together, they launched Healthybyjeen, a restaurant built on the idea of serving healthy meals with precise calorie and macronutrient counts, so that every customer knows exactly what they’re eating.</p>
